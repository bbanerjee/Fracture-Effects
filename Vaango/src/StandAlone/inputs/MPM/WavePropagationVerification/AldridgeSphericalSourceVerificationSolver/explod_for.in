NOTES:

1) Homogeneous and istropic elastic wholespace is characterized by 
   P-wave speed "alfa", S-wave speed "beta", and mass density "rho". 

2) tmin, dt, and tlen are the minimum time, time increment, and time duration
   of the trace simulation.  tmin and dt in seconds.

3) Center of source sphere is located at rectangular coordinates (xs, ys, zs).

4) Radius of source sphere is "rs" (with rs > 0).

5) samp is a source amplitude scalar.

6) stype:  source waveform type flag (stype=0: displacement;  
           stype=1:  velocity;
           stype=2:  acceleration;
           stype=4:  traction;
           stype=5:  pressure).

7) Number of receivers is "nr".

8) For EACH receiver, 7 parameters are required:

   rtype:  receiver type flag
           rtype=0: displacement transducer 
           rtype=1: velocity transducer
           rtype=2: acceleration transducer 
           rtype=4: pressure transducer.
   xr,yr,zr:  receiver position coordinates.
   ramp:  amplitude scalar for receiver output.
   theta, phi:  polar and azimuthal angles 
                (in a spherical polar coordinate system)
                that define the orientation of the receiver sensitivity axis:
                (0 .le. theta .le. 180)  and  (0 .le. phi .le. 360).
                For a pressure-type receiver, these angles are ignored.

9) Plot output option parameters:

   dscale;  distance scalar.
   tscale:  time scalar.
   ascale:  amplitude scalar.
   iplot:   option flag for plotting coordinate:
               x-coordinate:    iplot=1
               y-coordinate:    iplot=2
               z-coordinate:    iplot=3 
               receiver number: iplot=4
               no coordinate:   iplot=0.
            Numerical values having dimensions (i.e., positions, distances,
            lengths, wavespeeds, mass density, etc.) should be input in a 
            consistent set of units (e.g., all SI).
