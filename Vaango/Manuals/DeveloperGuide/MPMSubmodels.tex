\chapter{Submodels of MPM material models}
The previous chapter on the \Arena model showed that MPM constitutive models can
rapidly become unmanageable without sufficient object granularity.  To allow
for simpler model development and testing processes to be used in \Vaango, 
constitutive models are sometime broken up into submodels.

In \Vaango, we have the main constitutive models are located in the directory
\Textsfc{src/CCA/Components/MPM/ConstitutiveModel}.  Some of the models in
this directory depend of one of two sets of submodels.  The first set of 
submodels were designed circa 2004-2005 and are located in the directory
\Textsfc{...ConstitutiveModel/PlasticityModels}.  These models have been 
retained largely for backward compatibility with older plasticity models.
A more recent set of models (designed circa 2012) can be found in 
\Textsfc{...ConstitutiveModel/Models}.
