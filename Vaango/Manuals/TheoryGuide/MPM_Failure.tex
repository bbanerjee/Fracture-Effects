\chapter{Material failure}

\section{Introduction}
The primary technique used in \Vaango to simulate failure is damage evolution. An alternative
approach that can be used is to used material stability conditions to determine and propagate 
failure.

\section{Material stability conditions}
\subsection{Drucker's condition}
The simplest criterion that can be used is the Drucker stability postulate 
\cite{Drucker1959} which states that time rate of change of the rate of 
work done by a material cannot be negative.  Therefore, the material is 
assumed to become unstable (and a particle fails) when
\begin{equation}
  \dot\Bsig:\BD^p \le 0
\end{equation}

\subsection{Acoustic tensor criterion}
Another stability criterion that is less restrictive is the acoustic
tensor criterion which states that the material loses stability if the 
determinant of the acoustic tensor changes sign~\cite{Rudnicki1975,Yamamoto1978,Perzyna1998}.  

We assume that the strain is localized in a thin band with normal $\Bn$.  The band is 
assumed be homogeneous
but has slightly different material properties than the surrounding material.

To develop the bifurcation relations~\cite{Yamamoto1978}, assume that $\Bv^b$ is the 
velocity of a material point in the band ($\Omega_b$) and $\Bv^0$ is the velocity of the 
material outside the band ($\Omega_0$).  The deformation of the material outside the band
is assumed to be uniform.  The deformation within the band is also assumed to
be homogeneous.

We assume that stresses and rates of deformation have been rotated to the undeformed
configuration using the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient.

Consider the case where the local coordinates of points in the band are expessed in
terms of an orthonormal basis $\Be_1, \Be_2, \Be_3$ where $\Be_2 = \Bn$.  Then
a point $\Bx$ inside (or outside) the band can be expressed as $\Bx = x_i \Be_i$.

Continuity and the homogeneity of deformation in the two regions requires that 
only the velocity in the $\Bn$ direction can be different in the two regions.
This implies
\Beq
  \Bv^b(\Bx) - \Bv^0(\Bx) = \Bf(\Bn \cdot \Bx) = \Bf(x_2) 
\Eeq
where $\Bf$ is an unknown function.
The velocity gradient can be computed from the above relation as
\Beq \label{eq:gradv_b}
  \Grad{\Bv^b} = \Grad{\Bv^0} + \Deriv{\Bf}{x_2} \otimes \Bn = \Grad{\Bv^0} + \Bq \otimes \Bn
\Eeq
where
\Beq
  \Bq := \Deriv{\Bf}{x_2} = \begin{cases}
                              \Bzero   & \quad\text{for}\quad \Bx \in \Omega_0 \\
                              \Bq & \quad\text{for}\quad \Bx \in \Omega_b 
                            \end{cases}
\Eeq
The rate of deformation in the band is
\Beq \label{eq:d_b}
  \BdT^b = \Half\left[\Grad{\Bv^b} + (\Grad{\Bv^b})^T\right]
         = \Half\left[\Grad{\Bv^0} + (\Grad{\Bv^0})^T\right] + \Half(\Bq \otimes \Bn + \Bn \otimes \Bq)
         = \BdT^0 + \Half(\Bq \otimes \Bn + \Bn \otimes \Bq) \,.
\Eeq
The stress rate is related to the rate of deformation by
\Beq \label{eq:sigdot_1}
  \dot{\Bsig}^0 = \SfC^0 : \BdT^0 ~,~~
  \dot{\Bsig}^b = \SfC^b : \BdT^b = \SfC^b : \BdT^0 + \Half \SfC^b : (\Bq \otimes \Bn + \Bn \otimes \Bq) \,.
\Eeq
The minor symmetry of $\SfC$ implies that
\Beq \label{eq:sigdot_2}
  \dot{\Bsig}^b = \SfC^b : \BdT^0 +  \SfC^b : (\Bq \otimes \Bn) \,.
\Eeq
Homogeneity of the deformation also implies that
\Beq
  \Bn \cdot \Bsig^b = \Bn \cdot \Bsig^0 \,.
\Eeq
Taking the material time derivative of the above gives
\Beq \label{eq:ndot_rel}
  \dot{\Bn} \cdot \Bsig^b + \Bn \cdot \dot{\Bsig}^b = 
    \dot{\Bn} \cdot \Bsig^0 + \Bn \cdot \dot{\Bsig}^0 \,.
\Eeq
We need an expression for $\dot{\Bn}$.  To find that, note that if $\Bn_0$ and $\Bn$ are the unit normals 
to the band in the reference and current configurations, using Nanson's formula, we have
\Beq \label{eq:nanson}
  \Bn da = J (\BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0) dA ~,~~ J = \det\BF  \,.
\Eeq
Taking the time derivative of \eqref{eq:nanson},
\Beq 
  \dot{\Bn} da + \Bn \dot{da} = \Deriv{J}{t} (\BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0) dA + 
                                J \left(\Deriv{\BF^{-1}}{t}\right)^T \cdot \Bn_0 dA 
\Eeq
For the derivative of $J$, we have
\Beq
  \Deriv{J}{t} = \Partial{J}{\BF} : \dot{\BF} = J\BF^{-T}:\dot{\BF} = J \Tr(\dot{\BF}\cdot\BF^{-1})
    = J \Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) \,. 
\Eeq
We can also show that
\Beq
  \Deriv{\BF^{-1}}{t} = -\BF^{-1} \cdot \dot{\BF} \cdot \BF^{-1} 
                      = -\BF^{-1} \cdot \Grad{\Bv}\,.
\Eeq
Therefore, using \eqref{eq:nanson},
\Beq \label{eq:nanson_deriv}
  \Bal
  \dot{\Bn} da + \Bn \dot{da} &= J \Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) (\BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0) dA - 
                                 J (\Grad{\Bv})^T \cdot \BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0 dA  \\
    & = \Bn \cdot \left[\Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) \BI - \Grad{\Bv} \right] da \,.
  \Eal
\Eeq
To find $\dot{da}$, we compute a dot product of both sides of \eqref{eq:nanson} to get
\Beq 
  da^2 = J^2 (\BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0)\cdot(\BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0) dA^2 
       =  J^2 \Bn_0 \cdot (\BF^{-1}\cdot\BF^{-T}) \cdot \Bn_0 dA^2 \,.
\Eeq
The material time derivative of the above expression is
\Beq\label{eq:da_sq}
  2 da \dot{da} = 2 J \Deriv{J}{t} \Bn_0 \cdot (\BF^{-1}\cdot\BF^{-T}) \cdot \Bn_0 dA^2 + 
                  J^2 \Bn_0 \cdot \Deriv{}{t}(\BF^{-1}\cdot\BF^{-T}) \cdot \Bn_0 dA^2
\Eeq
For the derivative of the $\BF^{-1}$ product, we have
\Beq
  \Bal
  \Deriv{}{t}(\BF^{-1}\cdot\BF^{-T}) &= 
    \Deriv{\BF^{-1}}{t}\cdot\BF^{-T} + \BF^{-1}\cdot\left(\Deriv{\BF^{-1}}{t}\right)^T = 
    - \BF^{-1} \cdot \dot{\BF} \cdot \BF^{-1} \cdot \BF^{-T} 
    - \BF^{-1} \cdot \BF^{-T} \cdot \dot{\BF}^{T} \cdot \BF^{-T} \\
   & = - \BF^{-1} \cdot \Grad{\Bv} \cdot \BF^{-T} 
       - \BF^{-1} \cdot (\Grad{\Bv})^T \cdot \BF^{-T} 
     = - 2 \BF^{-1} \cdot \BdT \cdot \BF^{-T} \,.
  \Eal
\Eeq
Substitution into \eqref{eq:da_sq} gives
\Beq
  \Bal
  da \dot{da} &= J^2 \Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) \Bn_0 \cdot (\BF^{-1}\cdot\BF^{-T}) \cdot \Bn_0 dA^2 - 
                J^2 \Bn_0 \cdot (\BF^{-1}\cdot\BdT\cdot\BF^{-T}) \cdot \Bn_0 dA^2 \\
    &= \Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) (J \BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0 dA) \cdot (J \BF^{-T}\cdot \Bn_0 dA)  - 
                (J \BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0 dA) \cdot \BdT \cdot (J \BF^{-T} \cdot \Bn_0 dA) \\
    &= \Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) \Bn \cdot \Bn da^2  - \Bn \cdot \BdT \cdot \Bn da^2 
     = \Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) da^2  - \Bn \cdot \BdT \cdot \Bn da^2 \,.
  \Eal
\Eeq
Therefore,
\Beq \label{eq:da_dot}
  \dot{da} = \left[\Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) - \Bn \cdot \BdT \cdot \Bn \right] da 
           = \left[\Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) - \Bn \cdot \Grad{\Bv} \cdot \Bn \right] da \,.
\Eeq
Plugging \eqref{eq:da_dot} into \eqref{eq:nanson_deriv}, we have
\Beq 
  \Bal
  \dot{\Bn} da + 
  \Bn \left[\Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) - \Bn \cdot \BdT \cdot \Bn \right] da 
  = \Bn \cdot \left[\Tr(\Grad{\Bv}) \BI - \Grad{\Bv} \right] da \,.
  \Eal
\Eeq
That gives us the expression for $\dot{\Bn}$ that we seek,
\Beq \label{eq:ndot}
  \dot{\Bn} = \Bn \cdot \left[\BdT \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn) - \Grad{\Bv}\right] 
            = \Bn \cdot \Grad{\Bv} \cdot \left(\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI\right)  \,.
\Eeq
Using \eqref{eq:ndot} in \eqref{eq:ndot_rel}, we have
\Beq 
  \Bn \cdot \left[(\dot{\Bsig}^b - \dot{\Bsig}^0) + 
     \Grad{\Bv^b} \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0)\right] = 0\,.
\Eeq
Substituting equations \eqref{eq:sigdot_1}, \eqref{eq:sigdot_2}, and \eqref{eq:gradv_b},
\Beq 
  \Bn \cdot \left[(\SfC^b : \BdT^0 +  \SfC^b : (\Bq \otimes \Bn) - \SfC^0 : \BdT^0 ) + 
     \left(\Grad{\Bv^0} + \Bq \otimes\Bn\right) \cdot 
     (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0)\right] = 0\,.
\Eeq
Using the symmetry of stress and the projection $\Bn\otimes\Bn - \BI$, we can reorganize
the above expression into 
\Beq 
  \Bn \cdot \left[
    \left(\SfC^b + (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0) \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot \SfI\right) : (\Bq \otimes\Bn) + 
    (\SfC^b - \SfC^0) : \BdT^0 +  
      (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0) \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot \Grad{\Bv^0} 
    \right] = 0\,.
\Eeq
Further rearrangement leads to
\Beq
  \left[\Bn \cdot \left(\SfC^b + (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0) \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot \SfI\right) \cdot \Bn\right] \cdot \Bq  =  -\Bn \cdot \left[ (\SfC^b - \SfC^0) : \BdT^0 +  
      (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0) \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot \Grad{\Bv^0}\right] 
\Eeq
This equation has a solution ($\Bq$) only if 
\Beq
  \det\left[\Bn \cdot \left(\SfC^b + (\Bsig^b - \Bsig^0) \cdot (\Bn \otimes \Bn - \BI) \cdot \SfI\right) \cdot \Bn\right] \ne 0 \,.
\Eeq
The canonical bifurcation condition is obtained if $\Bsig^b = \Bsig^0$:
\Beq \label{eq:acoustic_tensor}
  \det(\BA) := \det(\Bn \cdot \SfC \cdot \Bn) = 0 
\Eeq
where $\BA$ is the \Textmag{acoustic tensor}.

Evaluation of the acoustic tensor requires a search for a normal vector 
around the material point and is therefore computationally expensive.  

\subsection{Becker's simplification}
A simplification of this criterion is a check which assumes that the direction 
of instability lies in the plane of the maximum and minimum principal 
stress~\cite{Becker2002}.  

Let the principal stresses be $\sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > \sigma_3$, and the 
corresponding principal directions (eigenvectors) are $\BE_1, \BE_2, \BE_3$.
We can express the unit normal to the band in this basis as $\Bn = n_i \BE_i$.

Then the bifurcation condition leads to the relation 
\begin{equation} 
  R_{ij} q_{j} = 0 ~;~~~
  R_{ij} = C_{ikj\ell} n_k n_\ell 
\end{equation} 
where $C_{ijk\ell}$ are the components of the co-rotational tangent
modulus tensor and $\sigma_{ij}$ are the components of the co-rotational 
stress tensor.  If $\det(R_{ij}) \le 0 $, then $q_j$ can be arbitrary and 
there is a possibility of strain localization.  If this condition for 
loss of hyperbolicity is met,  then a particle deforms in an unstable 
manner and failure can be assumed to have occurred at that particle.  
We use a combination of these criteria to simulate failure.
