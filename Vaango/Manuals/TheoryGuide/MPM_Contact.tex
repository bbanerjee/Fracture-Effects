The default behavior of \MPM is to handle interactions between objects using velocities on
the background grid.  However, beyond some simple situations, contact requires the application
of contact laws.  In the \Vaango implementation of friction contact, Coulomb friction is
assumed.  Alternative types of contact, such as adhesive contact. could also be implemented by
changing the contact law.

The purpose of the various contact algorithms in \Vaango is to correct the grid velocities
such that a particular set of contact assumptions are satisfied.  The two main algorithms
are \Textsfc{friction\_bard}, which is based on~\cite{Bard2001}, and \Textsfc{friction\_LR},
which is described in~\cite{Nairn2020}.

Let $m_p$, $\Bv_p$, $\Bp_p$ be the mass, velocity, and momentum of particle $p$. Also, let $m_g$,
$\Bv_g$, $\Bp_g$ be the mass, velocity, and momentum at a grid point $g$ due to nearby particles
in the region of influence.  Consider $N_\alpha$ objects that can potentially be in contact and index
then by the superscript $\alpha$.
Then, from \eqref{eq:vol_weighted_mom}, we have
\Beq
  m_g^\alpha = V_g^\alpha \rho_g^\alpha = \sum_p V_p^\alpha \rho_p^\alpha \bar{S}_{gp}
             = \sum_p m_p^\alpha \bar{S}_{gp} \quad \Tand \quad
  \Bp_g^\alpha = \sum_p \Bp_p^\alpha \bar{S}_{gp} \,.
\Eeq
In matrix notation,
\Beq
  \BmT_g^\alpha = \SfS^T \BmT_p^\alpha \quad \Tand \quad
  \BpT_g^\alpha = \SfS^T \BpT_p^\alpha \,.
\Eeq
Similarly, from \eqref{eq:mass_weighted_vel}, we have
\Beq 
  m_g^\alpha \Bv_g^\alpha = \sum_p m_p^\alpha \Bv_p^\alpha \bar{S}_{gp}
  \quad \implies \quad
  \Bv_g^\alpha = \frac{1}{m_g^\alpha} \sum_p m_p^\alpha \Bv_p^\alpha \bar{S}_{gp} \,.
\Eeq
In matrix form,
\Beq
  \BvT_g^\alpha = \SfS^\plus_\alpha \BvT_p^\alpha 
  \quad \text{where} \quad
  \SfS^\plus_\alpha = \left(\BmT_g^\alpha\right)^{-1} \SfS^T \BmT_p^\alpha \,.
\Eeq
Based on a local conservation of momentum, we define a {\em center-of-mass} velocity, $\Bv_g^{\Tcm}$,
at grid node $g$ for all the contacting objects:
\Beq \label{eq:center_of_mass_vel}
  \Bv_g^{\Tcm} = \frac{\sum_\alpha m_g^\alpha \Bv_g^\alpha}{\sum_\alpha m_g^\alpha} \,.
\Eeq
We also define an effective grid mass, $m_g^\Teff$, as
\Beq \label{eq:eff_mass}
  \frac{1}{m_g^\Teff} = \sum_\alpha \frac{1}{m_g^\alpha} \,.
\Eeq

\subsection{Bardenhagen et al. algorithm}
In the algorithm developed in~\cite{Bard2001}, a contact interface is defined as the set of
nodes for which individual grid velocities associated with each object differ from the
center of mass velocity:
\Beq
  \Bv_g^\alpha - \Bv_g^\Tcm \ne 0 \,.
\Eeq
Once this condition is identified, the surface normal $\Bn_g^\alpha$ is computed
from the mass distribution around node $g$, and the surface normal traction
$\Bt_g^\alpha$ is computed from the stresses in surrounding material points.

The contact condition is
\Beq \label{eq:contact_constraint_bard}
(\Bv_g^\alpha - \Bv_g^\Tcm)\cdot\Bn_g^\alpha > 0 \quad \Tand \quad
\Bt_g^\alpha \cdot \Bn_g^\alpha < 0 \,.
\Eeq
This condition indicates compressive stress at node $g$.  If this condition is not satisfied,
the objects are assumed to have separated.

To enforce \eqref{eq:contact_constraint_bard}, the grid node velocities are adjusted
such that momentum is conserved, i.e.,
\Beq
  \Delta (v_n)_g^\alpha = \Delta \Bv_g^\alpha \cdot \Bn_g^\alpha \quad \Tand \quad
  \Delta (v_t)_g^\alpha = \Delta \Bv_g^\alpha \cdot \left[
     \Bn_g^\alpha \times \frac{\Delta \Bv_g^\alpha \times \Bn_g^\alpha}%
                              {\Norm{\Delta \Bv_g^\alpha \times \Bn_g^\alpha}{}} \right]
\Eeq
where
\Beq
  \Delta \Bv_g^\alpha := \Bv_g^\alpha - \Bv_g^\Tcm \,.
\Eeq
Normal contact is enforced by adjusting material velocities by $\Delta (v_n)_g^\alpha$.
The tangential contact is enforced using Coulomb friction with the tangential velocity
determined using $\mu \Delta (v_n)_g^\alpha$ where $\mu$ is the friction coefficient. If
$\Delta (v_t)_g^\alpha < \mu \Delta (v_n)_g^\alpha$, the no-slip condition is enforced.
Otherwise, the tangential components of the nodal velocities are updated with a reduced
friction coefficient
\Beq
  \mu_\Tred = \Tmin\left(\mu, \frac{|\Delta (v_t)_g^\alpha|}{|\Delta (v_n)_g^\alpha|}\right) \,.
\Eeq

Returning to the problem of computing object outward normals at a grid point, the
traditional approach is to compute volume gradients using the set of particles influencing
a node:
\Beq
  \Bg_g^\alpha = \sum_{p^\alpha} \overbar{\BGv}_{gp} V_p 
\Eeq
where the gradients $\overbar{\BGv}_{gp}$ are as defined in \eqref{eq:G_mpm}, \eqref{eq:G_gimp}, and
\eqref{eq:G_cpdi}.  The normal to an object is calculated using
\Beq
  \Bn^\alpha = \frac{\Bg_g^\alpha}{\Norm{\Bg_g^\alpha}{}} \,.
\Eeq
For multiple objects, an average gradient can be computed for better accuracy.

\subsection{Nairn et al. algorithm}
The more recent algorithm by~\cite{Nairn2020} uses a logistic regression step to determine
contact.  The underlying approach is similar to that used in ~\cite{Bard2001}.  Since the approach
is at its simplest when only two objects are involved at a grid point, we will describe only that
case below.  Most situations with contact between multiple objects see~\cite{Nairn2020}.

Let the two objects be indexed by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  Let $\Bp_g^{\alpha 0}$ and $\Bp_g^{\beta 0}$
be the particle momenta projected to the grid.  We would like to compute the momentum correction
$\Delta \Bp$ so that momentum is conserved after contact.  Let the corrected momenta be
\Beq \label{eq:p_alpha_beta}
  \Bp_g^\alpha = \Bp_g^{\alpha 0} + \Delta \Bp \quad  \Tand \quad
  \Bp_g^\beta = \Bp_g^{\beta 0} - \Delta \Bp  \,.
\Eeq
If we restrict relative motion between objects at a grid point to the tangent plane, and let
$\Bthat$ be the direction of relative motion, then
\Beq \label{eq:v_alpha_beta}
  \Bv_g^\beta - \Bv_g^\alpha = k \Bthat \quad \implies \quad
  \frac{\Bp_g^\beta}{m_g^\beta} - \frac{\Bp_g^\alpha}{m_g^\alpha} = k \Bthat
  \quad \implies \quad
  m_g^\alpha \Bp_g^\beta - m_g^\beta \Bp_g^\alpha = m_g^\alpha m_g^\beta k \Bthat \,.
\Eeq
From the definition of the center-of-mass velocity in \eqref{eq:center_of_mass_vel} and
the effective grid mass~\eqref{eq:eff_mass}, we have
\Beq 
  \Bv_g^{\Tcm} = \frac{m_g^\alpha \Bv_g^\alpha + m_g^\beta \Bv_g^\beta}{m_g^\alpha + m_g^\beta} 
     = \frac{\Bp_g^\alpha + \Bp_g^\beta}{m_g^\alpha + m_g^\beta}  \quad \Tand \quad
  m_g^\Teff = \frac{m_g^\alpha m_g^\beta}{m_g^\alpha + m_g^\beta} \,.
\Eeq
Therefore,
\Beq \label{eq:p_alpha_beta_1}
  \Bp_g^\alpha + \Bp_g^\beta =  \frac{\Bv_g^{\Tcm} m_g^\alpha m_g^\beta}{m_g^\Teff} \,.
\Eeq
Solving for $\Bp_g^\alpha, \Bp_g^\beta$ from equations \eqref{eq:v_alpha_beta} and
\eqref{eq:p_alpha_beta_1}, we have
\Beq
  \Bp_g^\alpha = m_g^\alpha \Bv_g^\Tcm - m_g^\Teff k \Bthat \quad \Tand \quad
  \Bp_g^\beta = m_g^\beta \Bv_g^\Tcm + m_g^\Teff k \Bthat \,.
\Eeq
Therefore, from \eqref{eq:p_alpha_beta},
\Beq
\Delta \Bp = \Bp_g^\alpha - \Bp_g^{\alpha 0}
           = m_g^\alpha \Bv_g^\Tcm - m_g^\Teff k \Bthat - m_g^\alpha \Bv_g^{\alpha 0} 
           = m_g^\alpha (\Bv_g^\Tcm - \Bv_g^{\alpha 0}) - m_g^\Teff k \Bthat \,.
\Eeq
The quantity
\Beq
  \Delta \Bp^0 := m_g^\alpha (\Bv_g^\Tcm - \Bv_g^{\alpha 0})
\Eeq
is the initial change of momentum before tangential correction.
Since the contact force ($\Bf^c$) is given by the rate of change of momentum due to contact, we
have
\Beq
  \Bf^{c0} = \frac{\Delta \Bp^0}{\Delta t} \quad \Tand \quad
  \Bf^c = \frac{\Delta \Bp}{\Delta t} = \Bf^{c0} - \frac{m_g^\Teff k \Bthat}{\Delta t} \,.
\Eeq
where $\Delta t$ is the timestep size.
The contact compressive traction is found from the normal component of the contact force needed to
prevent interpenetration:
\Beq
  T^c_n = -\frac{1}{A^c}\,\Bf^{c0}\cdot\Bn
\Eeq
where $A^c$ is the contact area.  The tangential contact traction can be found using a
contact law:
\Beq
  T^c_t = \frac{1}{A^c}\,\Bf^c\cdot\Bthat
        = \frac{1}{A^c}\left[\Bf^{c0}\cdot\Bthat - \frac{m_g^\Teff k}{\Delta t}\right] \,.
\Eeq
Therefore, if $T^c_t = T^c_t(T^c_n)$ is a contact law, 
\Beq
  k = \frac{\Delta t}{m_g^\Teff} \left[\Bf^{c0} \cdot \Bthat - A^c T^c_t(T^c_n)\right] \,.
\Eeq
We can compute $k$ using the contact law $T^c_t(T^c_n)$ and then adjust $\Bv_g^\alpha$
and $\Bv_g^\beta$ using \eqref{eq:p_alpha_beta}.  Note that this process is identical to that
used in the Bardenhagen at al. algorithm.  The main difficulty is in finding where contact has occurred
and the quantities $\Bn$, $\Bthat$, and $A^c$.
