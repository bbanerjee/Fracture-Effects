\section{Introduction}

The material point method (MPM) was described by Sulsky et al.~\cite{sulskycmame,sulskycpc} as
an extension to the FLIP (Fluid-Implicit Particle) method of
Brackbill~\cite{brackbill-ruppel86}, which itself is an
extension of the particle-in-cell (PIC) method of
Harlow~\cite{harlow1963}.  Interestingly, the name ``material point method"
first appeared in the literature two years later in a description of
an axisymmetric form of the method~\cite{sulsky_axisym_1996}.  In both
FLIP and MPM, the basic idea is the same: objects are discretized into
particles, or material points, each of which contains all state data for the
small region of material that it represents.  This includes the position, mass, volume,
velocity, stress and state of deformation of that material.  MPM differs from
other so called ``mesh-free" particle methods in that, while each object
is primarily represented by a collection of particles, a computational mesh
is also an important part of the calculation.  Particles do not interact
with each other directly, rather the particle information is accumulated
to the grid, where the equations of motion are integrated forward in time.
This time advanced solution is then used to update the particle state.

The method usually uses a regular structured grid as a computational mesh.
While this grid, in principle, deforms as the material that it is representing
deforms, at the end of each timestep, it is reset to its original undeformed
position, in effect providing a new computational grid for each timestep.
The use of a regular structured grid for each time step has a number of
computational advantages.  Computation of spatial gradients is simplified.
Mesh entanglement, which can plague fully Lagrangian techniques, such as
the Finite Element Method (FEM), is avoided.  MPM has also been successful
in solving problems involving contact between colliding objects, having an
advantage over FEM in that the use of the regular grid eliminates the
need for doing costly searches for contact surfaces\cite{bard}.

In addition to the advantages that MPM brings, as with any numerical technique, it has its own set of shortcomings.  It is computationally more
expensive than a comparable FEM code.  Accuracy for MPM is typically lower
than FEM, and errors associated with particles moving around the computational
grid can introduce non-physical oscillations into the solution.  Finally,
numerical difficulties can still arise in simulations involving large
deformation that will prematurely terminate the simulation.  The severity of
all of these issues (except for the expense) has been significantly reduced
with the introduction of the Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method,
or GIMP\cite{bardgimp}.  The basic concepts associated with GIMP will be
described below.  Throughout this document, MPM (which
ends up being a special case of GIMP) will frequently be referred to
interchangably with GIMP.

In addition, MPM can be incorporated with a multi-material CFD algorithm
as the structural component in a fluid-structure interaction formulation.
This capability was first demonstrated in the CFDLIB codes from
Los Alamos by Bryan Kashiwa and co-workers\cite{kashiwa2000}.  There, as
in the Uintah-MPMICE component,
MPM serves as the Lagrangian description of the solid
material in a multimaterial CFD code.  Certain elements of the
solution procedure are based in the Eulerian CFD algorithm, including
intermaterial heat and momentum transfer as well as satisfaction
of a multimaterial equation of state.  The use of a Lagrangian method
such as MPM to advance the solution of the solid material eliminates
the diffusion typically associated with Eulerian methods.  The Uintah-MPM
component will be described in later chapter of this manual.

Subsequent sections of this chapter will first give a relatively brief
description of the MPM and GIMP algorithms.  This will, of course, be
focused mainly on describing the capabilities of the Uintah-MPM component.
This is followed by a section that attempts to relate the information in
Section~\ref{Sec:AlgDesc} to the implementation in Uintah.
Following that is a description of the information that goes into an input
file.  Finally, a number of examples are provided, along with representative
results.

\section{Algorithm Description} \label{Sec:AlgDesc}

Time and space prohibit an exhaustive description of the theoretical
underpinnings of the Material Point Method.   Here we will concentrate
on the discrete equations that result from applying a weak form analysis
to the governing equations.  The interested reader should
consult \cite{sulskycmame,sulskycpc} for the development of these discrete
equations in MPM, and \cite{bardgimp} for the development of the equations
for the GIMP method.  These end up being very similar, the differences in
how the two developments affect implementation will be described in
Section~\ref{gimp_mpm}.

In solving a structural mechanics problem with MPM, one begins by discretizing
the object of interest into a suitable number of particles, or ``material
points".  ({\bf Aside:}  What constitutes a suitable number is something of an open
question, but it is typically advisable to use at least two particles in each
computational cell in each direction, i.e. 4 particles per cell (PPC) in 2-D,
8 PPC in 3-D. In choosing the resolution of the computational grid, similar
considerations apply as for any computational method (trade-off between
time to solution and accuracy, use of resolution studies to ensure convergence
in results, etc.).)  Each of these particles will carry, minimally, the
following variables:
\begin{itemize}

\item position - $\bfx_p$
\item mass - $m_p$
\item volume - $v_p$
\item velocity - $\bfv_p$
\item stress - $\sig_p$ 
\item deformation gradient - $\bfF_p$

\end{itemize}

The description that follows is a recipe for advancing each of these
variables from the current (discrete) time $n$ to the subsequent
time $n+1$.  Note that particle mass, $m_p$, typically remains constant
throughout a simulation unless solid phase reaction models are utilized,
a feature that is not present in Uintah-MPM.  (Such models are available
in MPMICE, see Section \ref{Sec:MPMICE}.)  It is also important to point
out that the algorithm for advancing the timestep is based on the so-called
Update Stress Last (USL) algorithm.  The superiority of this approach over
the Update Stress First (USF) approach was clearly demonstrated by Wallstedt
and Guilkey \cite{WallstedtJCP}.  USF was the formulation used in Uintah
until mid-2008.

The discrete momentum equation that results from the weak form is given as:
\begin{eqnarray}
        \bfm \bfa &=& \bfF^{\rm{ext}} - \bfF^{\rm{int}}  \label{newton2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bfm$ is the mass matrix, $\bfa$ is the acceleration vector,
$\bfF^{\rm{ext}}$ is the external force vector (sum of the body forces and
tractions), and $\bfF^{\rm{int}}$ is the internal force vector resulting from
the divergence of the material stresses.  The construction of each of these
quantities, which are based at the nodes of the computational grid,
will be described below.

The solution begins by accumulating the particle state on the
nodes of the computational grid, to form the mass matrix $\bfm$ and to find
the nodal external forces $\bfF^{\rm{ext}}$, and velocities,
$\bfv$.  In practice, a lumped mass matrix is used to avoid the need to
invert a system of equations to solve Eq. \ref{newton2} for acceleration.
These quantities are calculated at individual nodes by the following equations,
where the $\sum\limits_{p}$ represents a summation over all particles:
\begin{eqnarray}
m_i = \sum_{p} S_{ip} m_p,  \;\;\;\;\;\; 
\bfv_i = \frac{\sum\limits_{p} S_{ip} m_p \bfv_p}{m_i},  \;\;\;\;\;\;
\bfF^{\rm{ext}}_i &=& \sum_{p} S_{ip} \bfF^{\rm{ext}}_p
\label{accumulate}
\end{eqnarray}
and $i$ refers to individual nodes of the grid.  $m_p$ is the particle
mass, $\bfv_p$ is the particle velocity, and $\bfF^{\rm{ext}}_p$ is the
external force on the particle.  The external forces that start on the
particles typically the result of tractions, the application of which will
be discussed in Section \ref{sec:PhysicalBCs}.
$S_{ip}$ is the shape function of the $ith$ node evaluated at $\bfx_p$.
The functional form of the shape functions differs between MPM and GIMP.
This difference is discussed in Section \ref{gimp_mpm}.

Following the operations in Eq.~\ref{accumulate}, $\bfF^{\rm{int}}$
is still required in order to solve for acceleration at the nodes.
This is computed at the nodes as a volume integral of the divergence
of the stress on the particles, specifically:

\begin{eqnarray}
\bfF^{\rm{int}}_i &=& \sum_{p} \bfG_{ip} \sig_p v_p,
\label{computeIntForce}  
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bfG_{ip}$ is the gradient of the shape function of the $ith$ node
evaluated at $\bfx_p$, and $\sig_p$ and $v_p$ are the time $n$ values of
particle stress and volume respectively.  

Equation \ref{newton2} can then be solved for $\bfa$.
\begin{eqnarray}
\bfa_i &=& \frac{\bfF_i^{\rm{ext}} - \bfF_i^{\rm{int}}}{m_i}
\label{MPM:acceleration}
\end{eqnarray}
An explicit forward Euler method is used for the time integration:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bfv_i^L= \bfv_i + \bfa_i \Delta{t}
\label{MPM:euler}
\end{eqnarray}

The time advanced grid velocity, $\bfv^L$ is used to compute a velocity
gradient at each particle according to:

\begin{equation}
\nabla \bfv_p = \sum_i \bfG_{ip} \bfv^L_i
\label{velgrad}
\end{equation}
This velocity gradient is used to update the particle's deformation gradient,
volume and stress.  First, an incremental deformation gradient is computed
using the velocity gradient:

\begin{equation}
\bfd \bfF_p^{n+1} = (\bfI+\nabla \bfv_p \Delta{t})
\label{Finc}
\end{equation}
Particle volume and deformation gradient are updated by:

\begin{eqnarray}
v_p^{n+1} = \rm{Det}(\bfd\bfF_p^{n+1})v_p^n,  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\bfF_p^{n+1}=\bfd\bfF_p^{n+1} \bfF_{p}^{n}
\label{p_vol}
\end{eqnarray}
Finally, the velocity gradient, and/or the deformation gradient are
provided to a constitutive model, which outputs a time advanced stress
at the particles.  Specifics of this operation will be further discussed
in Section~\ref{Sec:ConstitutiveModels}

At this point in the timestep, the particle position and velocity are explicitly
updated by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bfv_p (t + \Delta{t})  &=& \bfv_p (t)  + \sum_{i} S_{ip} \bfa_i  \Delta{t} 
\label{MPM:updateVp}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\bfx_p (t + \Delta{t})  &=& \bfx_p (t)  + \sum_{i} S_{ip} \bfv^L_i  \Delta{t}
\label{MPM:updateXp}
\end{eqnarray}
This completes one timestep, in that the update of all six of the variables
enumerated above (with the exception of mass, which is assumed to remain
constant) has been accomplished.  Conceptually, one can imagine that, since an
acceleration and velocity were computed at the grid, and an interval of time
has passed, the grid nodes also experienced a displacement.  This 
displacement also moved the particles in an isoparametric fashion.  In
practice, particle motion is accomplished by Equation~\ref{MPM:updateXp},
and the grid never deforms.  So, while the MPM literature will often refer
to resetting the grid to its original configuration, in fact, this 
isn't necessary as the grid nodes never leave that configuration.  Regardless,
at this point, one is ready to advance to the next timestep.

The algorithm described above is the core of the Uintah-MPM implementation.
However, it neglects a number of important considerations.  The first is
kinematic boundary conditions on the grid for velocity and acceleration.
The manner in which these are handled will be described in
Section~\ref{Sec:UintahImp}.  Next, is the use of advanced contact
algorithms.  By default, MPM enforces no-slip, no-interpenetration contact.
This feature is extremely useful, but it also means that two bodies initially
in ``contact" (meaning that they both contain particles whose data are
accumulated to common nodes) behave as if they are a single body.  To enable
multi-field simulations with frictional contact, or to impose displacement
based boundary conditions, e.g. a rigid piston, additional steps must be
taken.  These steps implement contact formulations such as that described
by Bardenhagen, et al.\cite{bard_contact}.  The {\it use} of the contact
algorithms is described in Section~\ref{Sec:Contact}, but the reader will be
referred to the relevant literature for their development.  Lastly, heat
conduction is also available in the explicit MPM code, although it may be
neglected via a run time option in the input file.  Explicit MPM is typically
used for high rate simulations in which heat conduction is negligible.

\section{Shape functions for MPM and GIMP} \label{gimp_mpm}

In both MPM and GIMP, the basic idea is the same: objects are discretized into
particles, or material points, each of which contains all state data for the
small region of material that it represents.  In MPM, these particles are spatially
Dirac delta functions, meaning that the material that each represents is
assumed to exist at a single point in space, namely the position of the
particle.  Interactions between the particles and the grid take place
using weighting functions, also known as shape functions or interpolation
functions.  These are typically, but not necessarily, linear, bilinear or
trilinear in one, two and three dimensions, respectively.

More recently, Bardenhagen and Kober~\cite{bardgimp} generalized the
development that gives rise to MPM, and suggested that MPM
may be thought of as a subset of their ``Generalized Interpolation
Material Point" (GIMP) method.  In the family of GIMP methods
one chooses a characteristic function $\chi_p$ to represent
the particles and a shape function $S_i$ as a basis of support on the
computational nodes.  An effective shape function $\bar{S}_{ip}$  is found
by the convolution of the $\chi_p$ and $S_i$ which is written as:
\begin{equation}
\bar{S}_{ip}(\bfx_p) = \frac{1}{V_p}  \int_{\Omega_p \cap \Omega} \chi_p(\bfx - \bfx_p) S_i(\bfx)\,\mathrm{d}\bfx .
\label{effectiveS}
\end{equation}
While the user has significant latitude in choosing
these two functions, in practice, the choice of $S_i$ is usually given
(in one-dimension) as,
\begin{equation}
S_i\left(x\right) = \begin{cases} 1 + {\left(x-x_i\right) / h} & {-h < x-x_i \le 0} \\
                    1 - {\left(x-x_i\right) / h} & {0  < x-x_i \le h} \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise},
       \end{cases}
\label{linear_shape}
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ is the vertex location, and $h$ is the cell width, 
assumed to be constant in this formulation, 
although this is not a general restriction on the method.
Multi-dimensional versions are constructed by forming tensor products of the
one-dimensional version in the orthogonal directions.  

When the choice of characteristic function is the Dirac delta,
\begin{equation}
\chi_p(\bfx) = \delta(\bfx-\bfx_p)V_p , \label{MPM_char}
\end{equation}
where $\bfx_p$ is the particle position, and $V_p$ is the particle volume,
then traditional MPM is recovered.  In that case, the effective shape function
is still that given by Equation~\ref{linear_shape}.  Its gradient is given by:

\begin{equation}
G_i\left(x\right) = \begin{cases} {1 / h} & {-h < x-x_i \le 0} \\
                    {-1 / h} & {0  < x-x_i \le h} \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise},
       \end{cases}
\label{linear_shape_grad}
\end{equation}

Plots of Equations~\ref{linear_shape} and~\ref{linear_shape_grad} are shown
below.  The discontinuity in the gradient gives rise to poor accuracy and
stability properties.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=.85]{mpm_basis.pdf}
  \caption{Effective shape function when using traditional MPM.}
  \label{Fig:MPMShape}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=.85]{mpm_grad.pdf}
  \caption{Gradient of the effective shape function when using traditional MPM.}
  \label{Fig:MPMShapeGrad}
\end{figure}

Typically, when an analyst indicates that
they are ``using GIMP" this implies use of the linear grid basis function
given in Eq.~\ref{linear_shape} and a ``top-hat" characteristic function,
given by (in one-dimension),
\begin{equation}
\chi_p(x) = H(x-(x_p-l_p))-H(x-(x_p+l_p)) , \label{GIMP_char}
\end{equation}
where $H(x)$ is the Heaviside function
($H(x)=0$ if $x<0$ and $H(x)=1$ if $x\ge0$) and $l_p$ is the half-length
of the particle.  When the convolution indicated in Eq.~\ref{effectiveS}
is carried out using the expressions in Eqns.~\ref{linear_shape}
 and~\ref{GIMP_char}, a closed form for the effective shape function can be
written as:
\begin{equation}
S_{i}\left(x_p\right) = \begin{cases}
   \frac{\left(h+l_p+\left(x_p-x_i\right)\right)^2}{4hl_p} & {-h -l_p < x_p-x_i \le -h+l_p} \\
   1 + \frac{\left(x_p-x_i\right)}{h} & {-h + l_p < x_p-x_i \le -l_p} \\
   1 - \frac{\left(x_p-x_i\right)^2 + l_p^2}{2hl_p} & {-l_p < x_p-x_i \le l_p} \\
   1 - \frac{\left(x_p-x_i\right)}{h} & {l_p  < x_p-x_i \le h-l_p} \\
   \frac{\left(h+l_p-\left(x_p-x_i\right)\right)^2}{4hl_p} & {h -l_p < x_p-x_i \le h+l_p} \\
   0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\label{gimp_shape}
\end{equation}
%
The gradient of which is:
\begin{equation}
G_i(x_p) = \begin{cases}
   \frac{h+l_p+\left(x_p-x_i\right)}{2 h l_p} & {-h -l_p < x_p-x_i \le -h+l_p} \\
   \frac{1}{h} & {-h + l_p < x_p-x_i \le -l_p} \\
   - \frac{\left(x_p-x_i\right)}{h l_p} & {-l_p < x_p-x_i \le l_p} \\
   - \frac{1}{h} & {l_p  < x_p-x_i \le h-l_p} \\
   - \frac{h+l_p-\left(x_p-x_i\right)}{2 h l_p} & {h -l_p < x_p-x_i \le h+l_p} \\
   0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\label{gimpGrad}
\end{equation}

Plots of Equations~\ref{gimp_shape} and~\ref{gimpGrad} are shown
below.  The continuous nature of the gradients are largely responsible
for the improved robustness and accuracy of GIMP over MPM.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=.85]{gimp_basis.pdf}
  \caption{Effective shape function when using GIMP.}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=.85]{gimp_grad.pdf}
  \caption{Gradient of the effective shape function when using GIMP.}
  \label{Fig:GradGIMP}
\end{figure}
%
There is one further consideration in defining the effective shape function,
and that is whether or not the size (length in 1-D) of the particle is kept
fixed (denoted as ``UGIMP" here)
or is allowed to evolve due to material deformations 
(``Finite GIMP" or ``Contiguous GIMP" in (1) and ``cpGIMP" here).
In one-dimensional
simulations, evolution of the particle (half-)length is straightforward,
\begin{equation}
l_p^n = F_p^n l_p^0 ,  \label{particle_length}
\end{equation} 
where $F_p^n$ is the deformation gradient at time $n$.
In multi-dimensional simulations, a similar approach can be used, assuming
an initially rectangular or cuboid particle, to find the current particle
shape.  The difficulty arises in evaluating Eq.~\ref{effectiveS} for
these general shapes.  One approach, apparently effective, has been to create
a cuboid that circumscribes the deformed particle shape~\cite{jinmaCMES2006}.
Alternatively, one can assume that the particle size remains constant (insofar
as it applies to the effective shape function evaluations only).  This is
the approach currently implemented in Uintah.

\section{Uintah Implementation} \label{Sec:UintahImp}

Users of Uintah-MPM needn't necessarily bother themselves with the
implementation in code of the algorithm described above.  This section
is intended to serve as a reference for users who find themselves needing
to modify the source code, or those who are simply interested.  Anyone
just wishing to run MPM simulations may skip ahead to
Sections~\ref{Sec:UintahSpecMPM} and~\ref{Sec:ExamplesMPM}.  The goal of
this section is to provide a mapping from the the algorithm described above
to the software that carries it out.  This won't be exhaustive, but will be a
good starting point for the motivated reader.

The source code for the Uintah-MPM implementation can be found in

\begin{lstlisting}
src/CCA/Components/MPM
\end{lstlisting}
Within that directory are a number of files and subdirectories, these will be
discussed as needed.  For the moment, consider the various files that end in
``{MPM.cc}":
\begin{lstlisting}
AMRMPM.cc  FractureMPM.cc  ImpMPM.cc  RigidMPM.cc  SerialMPM.cc  ShellMPM.cc
\end{lstlisting}

\tt AMRMPM.cc \normalfont is the nascent beginnings of an AMR implementation of MPM. 
It is far from complete and should be ignored.  \tt FractureMPM.cc \normalfont is an implementation of
the work of Guo and Nairn \cite{GuoNairn}, and while it is viable, it is
undocumented and unsupported.  \tt ShellMPM.cc \normalfont is a treatment of MPM particles
as shell and membrane elements, developed by Biswajit Bannerjee.  It is also
viable, but also undocumented and unsupported.  \tt ImpMPM.cc \normalfont is an implicit
time integration form of MPM based on the work of Guilkey and Weiss
\cite{Guilkey03}.  It is also viable, and future releases of Uintah will include
documentation of its capabilities and uses.  For now, interested readers
should contact Jim Guilkey directly for more information.  \tt RigidMPM.cc \normalfont contains
a very reduced level of functionality, and is used solely in conjunction with
the MPMArches component.

This leaves \tt SerialMPM.cc. \normalfont  This contains, despite its name, the parallel
implementation of the algorithm described above in Section~\ref{Sec:AlgDesc}.
For now, we will skip over the initialization procedures such as:
\begin{lstlisting}
SerialMPM::problemSetup
SerialMPM::scheduleInitialize
SerialMPM::actuallyInitialize
\end{lstlisting}
and focus mainly on the timestepping algorithm described above.  Reference
will be made back to these functions as needed in
Section~\ref{Sec:UintahSpecMPM}.

Each of the Uintah components contains a function called \tt
scheduleTimeAdvance. \normalfont The algorithms implemented in these
components are broken into a number of steps.  The implementation of
these steps in Uintah take place in ``tasks".  Each task is
responsible for performing the calculations needed to accomplish that
step in the algorithm.  Thus, each task requires some data upon which
to operate, and it also creates some data, either as a final result,
or as input to a subsequent task.  Before individual tasks are
executed, each is first ``scheduled".  The scheduling of tasks
describes the dataflow and data dependencies for a given algorithm.
By describing the data dependencies, both temporally and spatially,
each task can be executed in the proper order, and communication tasks
can automatically be generated by the Uintah infrastructure to achieve
parallelism.  Thus, scheduleTimeAdvance calls a series of functions,
each of which schedules the individual tasks.  Let's begin by looking
at the \tt scheduleTimeAdvance \normalfont for \tt SerialMPM,
\normalfont pasted below.

\begin{lstlisting}

SerialMPM::scheduleTimeAdvance(const LevelP & level,

  if(flags->d_canAddMPMMaterial){
    //  This checks to see if the model on THIS patch says that it's

    scheduleCheckNeedAddMPMMaterial(         sched, patches, matls);

    //  This one checks to see if the model on ANY patch says that it's
    //  time to add a new material
    scheduleSetNeedAddMaterialFlag(         sched, level,   matls);
  }

  sched->scheduleParticleRelocation(level, lb->pXLabel_preReloc,
                                    d_sharedState->d_particleState_preReloc,
                                    lb->pXLabel,
                                    d_sharedState->d_particleState,
                                    lb->pParticleIDLabel, matls);
  if(d_analysisModule){
    d_analysisModule->scheduleDoAnalysis( sched, level);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The preceding includes scheduling for a number of rarely used features.
For now, let's condense the preceding to the essential tasks:

\begin{lstlisting}
void
SerialMPM::scheduleTimeAdvance(const LevelP & level,
                               SchedulerP   & sched)
{
  if (!flags->doMPMOnLevel(level->getIndex(), level->getGrid()->numLevels()))
    return;

  const PatchSet* patches = level->eachPatch();
  const MaterialSet* matls = d_sharedState->allMPMMaterials();

  scheduleApplyExternalLoads(             sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleInterpolateParticlesToGrid(     sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleExMomInterpolated(              sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleComputeInternalForce(           sched, patches, matls);

  scheduleComputeAndIntegrateAcceleration(sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleExMomIntegrated(                sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleSetGridBoundaryConditions(      sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleComputeStressTensor(            sched, patches, matls);
  scheduleInterpolateToParticlesAndUpdate(sched, patches, matls);

  sched->scheduleParticleRelocation(level, lb->pXLabel_preReloc,
                                    d_sharedState->d_particleState_preReloc,
                                    lb->pXLabel,
                                    d_sharedState->d_particleState,
                                    lb->pParticleIDLabel, matls);
}
\end{lstlisting}

As described above, each of the ``schedule" functions describes
dataflow, and it also calls the function that actually executes the
task.  The naming convention is illustrated by an example, \tt
scheduleComputeAndIntegrateAcceleration \normalfont calls \tt
computeAndIntegrateAcceleration. \normalfont Let's examine this
particular task, which executes Equations~\ref{MPM:acceleration}
and~\ref{MPM:euler}, more carefully.  First, the scheduling of the
task:

\begin{lstlisting}
void SerialMPM::scheduleComputeAndIntegrateAcceleration(SchedulerP& sched,
                                                       const PatchSet* patches,
                                                       const MaterialSet* matls)
{
  if (!flags->doMPMOnLevel(getLevel(patches)->getIndex(),
                           getLevel(patches)->getGrid()->numLevels()))
    return;

  printSchedule(patches,cout_doing,"MPM::scheduleComputeAndIntegrateAcceleration\t\t\t\t");

  Task* t = scinew Task("MPM::computeAndIntegrateAcceleration",
                        this, &SerialMPM::computeAndIntegrateAcceleration);

  t->requires(Task::OldDW, d_sharedState->get_delt_label() );

  t->requires(Task::NewDW, lb->gMassLabel,          Ghost::None);
  t->requires(Task::NewDW, lb->gInternalForceLabel, Ghost::None);
  t->requires(Task::NewDW, lb->gExternalForceLabel, Ghost::None);
  t->requires(Task::NewDW, lb->gVelocityLabel,      Ghost::None);

  t->computes(lb->gVelocityStarLabel);
  t->computes(lb->gAccelerationLabel);

  sched->addTask(t, patches, matls);
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \tt if \normalfont statement basically directs the schedule to only do this task on the 
finest level (MPM can be used in AMR simulations, but only at the finest
level.)  The \tt printSchedule \normalfont command is in place for debugging purposes,
this type of print statement can be turned on by setting an environmental
variable.  The real business of this task begins with the declaration of the
Task.  In the task declaration, the function associated with that task is
identified.  Subsequent to that is a description of the data dependencies.
Namely, this task \tt requires \normalfont the mass, internal and external forces as well
as velocity on the grid.  No ghost data are required as this task is a 
node by node calculation.  It also requires the timestep size.  Note also
that most of the required data are needed from the \tt NewDW \normalfont where
\tt DW \normalfont refers to
DataWarehouse.  This simply means that these data were calculated by an
earlier task in the current timestep.  The timestep size for this step
was computed in the previous timestep, and thus is required from the \tt OldDW. \normalfont
Finally, this task \tt computes \normalfont the acceleration and time advanced velocity
at each node.

The code to execute this task is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
void SerialMPM::computeAndIntegrateAcceleration(const ProcessorGroup*,
                                                const PatchSubset* patches,
                                                const MaterialSubset*,
                                                DataWarehouse* old_dw,
                                                DataWarehouse* new_dw)
{
  for(int p=0;p<patches->size();p++){
    const Patch* patch = patches->get(p);
    printTask(patches, patch,cout_doing,"Doing computeAndIntegrateAcceleration\t\t\t\t");

    Ghost::GhostType  gnone = Ghost::None;
    Vector gravity = d_sharedState->getGravity();
    for(int m = 0; m < d_sharedState->getNumMPMMatls(); m++){
      MPMMaterial* mpm_matl = d_sharedState->getMPMMaterial( m );
      int dwi = mpm_matl->getDWIndex();

      // Get required variables for this patch
      constNCVariable<Vector> internalforce, externalforce, velocity;
      constNCVariable<double> mass;

      delt_vartype delT;
      old_dw->get(delT, d_sharedState->get_delt_label(), getLevel(patches) );

      new_dw->get(internalforce,lb->gInternalForceLabel, dwi, patch, gnone, 0);
      new_dw->get(externalforce,lb->gExternalForceLabel, dwi, patch, gnone, 0);
      new_dw->get(mass,         lb->gMassLabel,          dwi, patch, gnone, 0);
      new_dw->get(velocity,     lb->gVelocityLabel,      dwi, patch, gnone, 0);

      // Create variables for the results
      NCVariable<Vector> velocity_star,acceleration;
      new_dw->allocateAndPut(velocity_star, lb->gVelocityStarLabel, dwi, patch);
      new_dw->allocateAndPut(acceleration,  lb->gAccelerationLabel, dwi, patch);

      acceleration.initialize(Vector(0.,0.,0.));
      double damp_coef = flags->d_artificialDampCoeff;

      for(NodeIterator iter=patch->getExtraNodeIterator__New();
                        !iter.done();iter++){
        IntVector c = *iter;
        Vector acc(0.,0.,0.);
        if (mass[c] > flags->d_min_mass_for_acceleration){
          acc  = (internalforce[c] + externalforce[c])/mass[c];
          acc -= damp_coef*velocity[c];
        }
        acceleration[c] = acc +  gravity;
        velocity_star[c] = velocity[c] + acceleration[c] * delT;
      }
    }    // matls
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This task contains three nested for loops.  First, is a loop over all of the
``patches" that the processor executing this task is responsible for.  Next
is a loop over all materials (imagine a simulation involving the interaction
between, say, tungsten and copper).  Within this loop, the required data
are retrieved from the \tt new\_dw \normalfont (New DataWarehouse) and space for the data
to be created is allocated.  The final loop is over all of the nodes on
the current patch, and the calculations described by
Equations~\ref{MPM:acceleration} and~\ref{MPM:euler} are carried out.  (This
also includes a linear damping term not described above.)

Let's consider each task in turn.  The remaining tasks will be described
in much less detail, but the preceding dissection of a fairly simple task,
along with a description of what the remaining tasks are intended to 
accomplish, should allow interested individuals to follow the remainder
of the Uintah-MPM implementation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt scheduleApplyExternalLoads \normalfont} This task is mainly responsible for
applying traction boundary conditions described in the input file.  This is
done by assigning external force vectors to the particles.  If the user
wishes to apply a load that is not possible to acheive via the input file
options, it is straightforward to modify the code here to do ``one-off" tests.

\item {\tt scheduleInterpolateParticlesToGrid \normalfont}   The name of this task was
poorly chosen, but has persisted.  This task carries out the operations given
in Equation~\ref{accumulate}.  It also sets boundary conditions on some of
the variables, such as the grid temperature, and grid velocity 
(in the case of symmetry BCs).

\item {\tt scheduleExMomInterpolated \normalfont}  This task actually exists in one
of the contact models which can be found in the \tt Contact \normalfont directory.  Each of those
models has two main tasks. This is the the first of those. It is responsible
for modifying the grid velocity computed by interpolateParticlesToGrid according
to the rules for the particular contact model chosen in the input file.  These
models are briefly described in Section~\ref{Sec:Contact}. 

\item {\tt scheduleComputeInternalForce \normalfont} This task computes the volume
integral of the divergence of stress.  Specifically, it carries out the
operation given in Equation~\ref{computeIntForce}.  It also computes some
diagnostic data, if requested in the input file, such as the reaction forces
(tractions) on the boundaries of the computational domain.

\item {\tt scheduleComputeAndIntegrateAcceleration \normalfont} As described previously,
this task carries out the operations described in 
Equations~\ref{MPM:acceleration} and~\ref{MPM:euler}.

\item {\tt scheduleExMomIntegrated \normalfont}  This is the second of the contact tasks
(see above).  It is responsible for modifiying the time advanced grid velocity
computed in \tt computeAndIntegrateAcceleration. \normalfont

\item {\tt scheduleSetGridBoundaryConditions \normalfont}  This task sets boundary conditions
on the time advanced grid velocity.  It also sets an acceleration boundary
condition as well.  However, rather than just setting the acceleration
to a given value, it is computed by solving Equation~\ref{MPM:euler} for
acceleration, and then recomputing the acceleration (on all nodes) as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bfa_i= \frac{\bfv^L_i - \bfv_i}{\Delta{t}}
\label{MPM:accBC}
\end{eqnarray}
Doing this operation on all nodes has several advantages.  For most interior
nodes, the value for acceleration will be unchanged, but for nodes on the 
where the velocity has been altered by enforcing boundary conditions, and
for nodes at which the contact models have altered the velocity, the acceleration
will be modified to reflect that alteration.

\item{\tt scheduleComputeStressTensor \normalfont}  The task, \tt computeStressTensor, \normalfont
exists in each of the models in the \tt ConstitutiveModel \normalfont directory.  Each
model is responsible for carrying out the operations given in
Equation~\ref{p_vol}, and of course, as the name implies, it also computes
the material stress.  This task has one additional important function,
and that is computing the timestep size for the subsequent step.  The CFL
condition dictates that the timestep size be limited according to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta{t} < \frac{\Delta{x}}{c+|u|}
\label{MPM:CFL}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta{x}$ is the cell spacing, $c$ is the wavespeed in the material,
and $|u|$ is the magnitude of the local velocity.  Because the wavespeed 
may depend on the state of stress that a material is in, this task provides
a convenient time at which to make this calculation.  A timestep size is
computed for all particles, and the minimum for the particle set on a given
patch is put into a ``reduction variable".  The Uintah infrastructure then
does a global reduction to select the smallest timestep from across the
domain.

\item {\tt scheduleInterpolateToParticlesAndUpdate \normalfont}  This task carries out the
operations in Equations~\ref{MPM:updateVp} and~\ref{MPM:updateXp}, namely updating
the particle state based on the grid solution.

\item {\tt scheduleParticleRelocation \normalfont}  This task is not actually located
in the MPM code, but in the Uintah infrastructure.  The idea is that as particles
move, some will cross patch boundaries, and their data will need to be sent to
other processors.  This task is responsible for identifying particles that have
left the patch that they were on, finding where they went, and sending their
data to the correct processor.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Uintah Specification} \label{Sec:UintahSpecMPM}

Uintah input files are constructed in XML format.  Each begins with:

\begin{lstlisting}
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='ISO-8859-1' ?>
\end{lstlisting}
while the remainder of the file is enclosed within the following tags:
\begin{lstlisting}
<Uintah_specification>
</Uintah_specification>
\end{lstlisting}

The following subsections describe the remaining inputs needed to construct
an input file for an MPM simulation.  The order of the various sections 
of the input file is not important.  {\bf The MPM, ICE and MPMICE components
are dimensionless calculations.  It is the responsibility of the analyst
to provide the following inputs using a consistent set of units.}

\subsection{Common Inputs} \label{Sec:commonInputs}

Each Uintah component is invoked using a single executable called
\it sus \normalfont, which chooses the type of simulation
to execute based on the \it SimulationComponent \normalfont tag in the
input file.  For the case of MPM simulations, this looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
 <SimulationComponent type="mpm" />
\end{lstlisting}

There are a number of fields that are required for any component.  The first
is that describing the timestepping parameters, these are largely common to
all components, and are described in Section~\ref{Sec:TimeRelatedVariables}.
The only one that bears commenting on at this point is:

\begin{lstlisting}
  <timestep_multiplier>    0.5     </timestep_multiplier>
\end{lstlisting}
This is effectively the CFL number for MPM simulations, that is the number
multiplied by the timestep size that is automatically calculated by the MPM
code.  Experience indicates that one should generally keep this value below
$0.5$, and should expect to use smaller values for high-rate, large-deformation
simulations.

The next field common to the input files for all components is:

\begin{lstlisting}
   <DataArchiver>
   </DataArchiver>
\end{lstlisting}
This is described in Section~\ref{Sec:DataArchiver}.  To see a list of
variables available for saving in MPM simulations, execute the following
command from the \tt StandAlone \normalfont directory:

\begin{lstlisting}
inputs/labelNames mpm
\end{lstlisting}
Note that for visualizing particle data, one must save \tt p.x, \normalfont
and at least one other variable by which to color the particles.

The other principle common field is that which describes the computational
grid.  For MPM, this is typically broken up into two parts, the
\tt <Level> \normalfont section specifies the physical extents and spatial
resolution of the grid.  For more information, consult Section~\ref{Sec:Grid}.
The other part specifies kinematic boundary conditions on the grid boundaries.
These are discussed below in Section~\ref{Sec:MPM_BCs}.

\subsection{Physical Constants} \label{Sec:physicalConstants}
The only physical constant required (or optional for that matter) for
MPM simulations is gravity, this is specified as:

\begin{lstlisting}
<PhysicalConstants>
   <gravity>            [0,0,0]   </gravity>
</PhysicalConstants>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{MPM Flags} \label{Sec:MPMFlags}

There are many options available when running MPM simulations.  These
are generally specified in the \tt <MPM> \normalfont section of the input file.
Below is a list of these options taken from
\tt inputs/UPS\_SPEC/mpm\_spec.xml \normalfont 
This file also gives possible values, or at least expected datatype,
for these flags.  A description of their functionality is forthcoming,
in the meantime, consult the code and input files.  A default value is
set for many, see \tt MPM/MPMFlags.cc \normalfont for more.

\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Material Properties} \label{Sec:mat_props}

The \tt Material Properties \normalfont section of the input file
actually contains not only those, but also the geometry and initial
condition data as well.  Below is a simple example, copied from
\tt inputs/MPM/disks.ups. \normalfont  The \tt name \normalfont field
is optional.  The first field is the material \tt <density>. \normalfont
The \tt <constitutive\_model> \normalfont field refers
to the model used to generate a stress tensor on each material point.
The use of these models is described in detail in
Section~\ref{Sec:ConstitutiveModels}.  Next are the thermal transport properties,
\tt <thermal\_conductivity> \normalfont and 
\tt <specific\_heat>. \normalfont  Note that these are required even if
heat conduction is not being computed.  These are the required material
properties.  There are additional optional parameters that are used in
other auxiliary calculations, for a list of these
see the \tt inputs/UPS\_SPEC/mpm\_spec.xml \normalfont.

Next is the specification of the geometry, and, along with it, the initial
state of the material contained in that geometry.  For more information on
how initial geometry can be specified, see Section~\ref{Sec:GeometryObjects}.  Within the
\tt <geom\_object> \normalfont is the \tt <res> \normalfont field.  This
indicates how many particles per cell are to be used in each of the 
coordinate directions.  Following that are initial values for velocity and
temperature.  Finally, the \tt <color> \normalfont designation has a number
of uses, for example when one wishes to identify initially distinct regions
of the same material.  In Section~\ref{Sec:OTFA_MPM} is a description of how
this field is used to identify particles for on the fly data extraction.

An arbitray number of \tt <material> \normalfont fields can be specified.
As the calculation proceeds, each of these materials has their own field
variables, and, as such, each material behaves independently of the others.
Interactions between materials occur as a result of ``contact" models.
Their use is described in detail in Section~\ref{Sec:Contact}.

           </material>

\subsection{Contact}  \label{Sec:Contact}

When multiple materials are specified in the input file, each material
interacts with its own field variables.  In other words, each material has
its own mass, velocity, acceleration, etc.  Without any mechanism for their
interaction, each material would behave as if it were the only one in the
domain.  Contact models provide the mechanism by which to specify rules
for inter material interactions.  There are a number of contact models
from which to choose, the use of each is described next.  See the input
file segment in Section~\ref{Sec:mat_props} for an example of their proper
placement in the input file, namely, after all of the MPM materials have
been described.

The simplest contact model is the \tt null \normalfont model, which indicates
that no inter material interactions are to take place.  This is typically only
used in single material simulations.  Its usage looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
           <contact>
             <type>null</type>
           </contact>
\end{lstlisting}

The next simplest model is the \tt single\_velocity \normalfont model.
The basic MPM formulation provides ``free" no-slip, no-interpenetration
contact, assuming that all particle data communicates with a single field
on the grid.  For a single material simulation with multiple objects, that
is the case.  If one wishes to achieve that behavior in Uintah-MPM when
multiple materials are present, the \tt single\_velocity \normalfont contact
model should be used.  It is specified as:

\begin{lstlisting}
           <contact>
             <type>single_velocity</type>
             <materials>[0,1]</materials>
           </contact>
\end{lstlisting}
Note that for this, and all of the contact models,
the \tt <materials> \normalfont tag is optional.  If it is omitted,
the assumption is that all materials will interact via the same contact model.
(This will be further discussed below.)

The ultimate in contact models is the \tt friction \normalfont contact 
model.  For a full description, the reader is directed to the paper by
Bardenhagen et al.\cite{bard_contact}.  Briefly, the model both overcomes
some deficiences in the single velocity field contact (either the ``free"
contact or the model described above, which behave identically), and it
enables some additional features.  With single velocity field contact,
initially adjacent objects are treated as if they are effectively stuck
together.  The friction contact model overcomes this by detecting if
materials are approaching or departing at a given node.  If they are
approaching, contact is ``enforced" and if they are departing, another
check is made to determine if the objects are in compression or tension.
If they are in compression, then they are still rebounding from each other,
and so contact is enforced.  If tension is detected, they are allowed
to move apart independently.  Frictional sliding is allowed, based on
the value specified for \tt <mu> \normalfont and the normal force between
the objects.  An example of the use of this model is given here:

\begin{lstlisting}
           <contact>
              <type>friction</type>
              <materials>[0,1,2]</materials>
              <mu> 0.5 </mu>
           </contact>
\end{lstlisting}

A slightly simplified version of the friction model is the
\tt <approach> \normalfont model.  It is the same as the frictional model
above, except that it doesn't make the additional check on the traction
between two bodies at each node.  At times, it is necessary to neglect this,
but some loss of energy will result.  Specification is of the model is 
also nearly identical:

\begin{lstlisting}
           <contact>
              <type>approach</type>
              <materials>[0,1,2]</materials>
              <mu> 0.5 </mu>
           </contact>
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, the contact infrastructure is also used to provide a moving
displacement boundary condition.  Imagine a billet being smashed by a
rigid platen, for example.  Usage of this model, known as
\tt <specified> \normalfont contact, looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
           <contact>
             <type>specified</type>
             <filename>TXC.txt</filename>
             <materials>[0,1,2]</materials>
             <master_material>0</master_material>
             <direction>[1,1,1]</direction>
             <stop_time>1.0 </stop_time>
             <velocity_after_stop>[0, 0, 0]</velocity_after_stop>
           </contact>
\end{lstlisting}
For reasons of backwards compatibility, the
\tt <type>specified</type> \normalfont is interchangable with
\tt <type>rigid</type>. \normalfont  By default, when either model is
chosen, material 0 is the ``rigid" material, although this can be
over ridden by the use of the
\tt <master\_material> \normalfont field.  If no
\tt <filename> \normalfont field is specified, then the particles of the
rigid material proceed with the velocity that they were given as their
initial condition, either until the reach a computational boundary, or
until the simulation time has reached \tt <stop\_time>, \normalfont after
which, their velocity becomes that given in the
\tt <velocity\_after\_stop> \normalfont field.  The \tt <direction> \normalfont
field indicates in which cartesian directions contact should be specified.
Values of $1$ indicate that contact should be specified, $0$ indicates that
the subject materials should be allowed to slide in that direction.  If
a \tt <filename> \normalfont field {\it is} specified, then the user can
create a text file which contains four entries per line.  These are:
\begin{lstlisting}
time1 velocity_x1 velocity_y1 velocity_z1
time2 velocity_x2 velocity_y2 velocity_z2
     .
     .
     .
\end{lstlisting}
The velocity of the rigid material particles will be set to these values,
based on linear interpolation between times, until \tt <stop\_time> \normalfont
is reached.  Note, one should not try to apply traction boundary conditions
(via the  \TT{<PhysicalBC>} tag), to the rigid material used in this type of contact, as this constitutes trying to mix displacement and traction boundary
conditions. 

Finally, it is possible to specify more than one contact model.  Suppose
one has a simulation with three materials, one rigid, and the other two
deformable.  The user may want to have the rigid material interact in a
rigid manner with the other two materials, while the two deformable materials
interact with each other in a single velocity field manner.  Specification
for this, assuming the rigid material is $0$ would look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
            <contact>
                <type>single_velocity</type>
                <materials>[1,2]</materials>
            </contact>

            <contact>
                <type>specified</type>
                <filename>prof.txt</filename>
                <stop_time>1.0</stop_time>
                <direction>[0, 0, 1]</direction>
            </contact>
\end{lstlisting}
An example of this usage can be found in \tt inputs/MPM/twoblock-single-rigid.ups. \normalfont

\section{BoundaryConditions} \label{Sec:MPM_BCs}

Boundary conditions must be specified on each face of the computational
domain $(x^-, x^+, y^-, y^+,z^-,z^+)$ for each material.  An example of their
specification is as follows, where the entire \tt <Grid> \normalfont field
is included for context:
\begin{lstlisting}
    <Grid>
       <BoundaryConditions>
         <Face side = "x-">
             <BCType id = "all" var = "Dirichlet" label = "Velocity">
                   <value> [0.0,0.0,0.0] </value>
             </BCType>
         </Face>
         <Face side = "x+">
            <BCType id = "all" var = "Neumann" label = "Velocity">
                 <value> [0.0,0.0,0.0] </value>
            </BCType>
         </Face>
         <Face side = "y-">
           <BCType id = "all" var = "Dirichlet" label = "Velocity">
                  <value> [0.0,0.0,0.0] </value>
           </BCType>
         </Face>
         <Face side = "y+">
           <BCType id = "all" var = "Neumann" label = "Velocity">
                  <value> [0.0,0.0,0.0] </value>
           </BCType>
         </Face>
         <Face side = "z-">
           <BCType id = "all" var = "symmetry" label = "Symmetric"> </BCType>
         </Face>
         <Face side = "z+">
           <BCType id = "all" var = "symmetry" label = "Symmetric"> </BCType>
         </Face>
       </BoundaryConditions>
       <Level>
\end{lstlisting}

... See Section~\ref{Sec:Grid} ...

\begin{lstlisting}
       </Level>
    </Grid>
\end{lstlisting}

The three main types of numerical boundary conditions (BCs) that can
be applied are ``Neumann", ``Dirichlet", and ``Symmetric", and the use of
each is illustrated above.  In the case of
MPM simulations, Neumann BCs are used when one wishes to allow particles to
advect freely out of the computational domain.  Dirichlet BCs are used to
specify a velocity, zero or otherwise (indicated by the \tt <value> \normalfont
tag), on one of the computational boundaries.
Symmetric BCs are used to indicate a plane of symmetry.  This has a variety
of uses.  The most obvious is simply when a simulation of interest has symmetry
that one can take advantage of to reduce the cost of a calculation.  Similarly,
since Uintah is a three-dimensional code, if one wishes to achieve plane-strain
conditions, this can be done by carrying out a simulation that is one cell thick
with Symmetric BCs applied to each face of the plane, as in the example above.
Finally, Symmetric BCs also provide a free slip boundary.

There is also the field \tt id = "all" \normalfont.  In principal, one could
set different boundary condition types for different materials.  In practice,
this is rarely used, so the usage illustrated here should be used.

\subsection{Physical Boundary Conditions} \label{sec:PhysicalBCs}

It is often more convenient to apply a specified load at the MPM particles.
The load may be a function of time.  Such a load versus time curve is called
a {\bf load curve}.
In Uintah, the load curve infrastructure is available for general use
(and not only for particles).  However, it has been implemented only for
a special case of pressure loading.  Namely, a surface is
specified through the use of the \tt <geom\_object> \normalfont description,
and a pressure vs. time curve is described by specifying their values
at discrete points in time, between which linear interpolation is used
to find values at any time.  At $t=0$, those particles in the vicinity
of the the surface are tagged with a load curve ID, and those particles
are assigned external forces such that the desired pressure is achieved.

We invoke the load curve in the \TT{<MPM>} section
(See Section~\ref{Sec:MPMFlags})of the input file
using  \TT{<use_load_curves> true </use_load_curves>}.  The default value
is \TT{<use_load_curves> false </use_load_curves>}.

In Uintah, a load curve infrastructure is implemented in the file \\
\TT{.../MPM/PhysicalBC/LoadCurve.h}.  This file is essentially a templated
structure that has the following private data
\begin{lstlisting}
  // Load curve information 
  std::vector<double> d_time;
  std::vector<T> d_load;
  int d_id;
\end{lstlisting}
The variable \TT{d_id} is the load curve ID, \TT{d_time} is the time,
and \TT{d_load} is the load.  Note that the load can have any form - scalar,
vector, matrix, etc.

In our current implementation, the actual specification of the load curve
information is in the \TT{<PhysicalBC>} section of the input file.  The
implementation is limited in that it applies only to pressure boundary
conditions for some special geometries (the implementation is in
\TT{.../MPM/PhysicalBC/PressureBC.cc}).  However, the load curve template can
be used in other, more general, contexts.

A sample input file specification of a pressure load curve is shown below.
In this case, a pressure is applied to the inside and outside of a cylinder.
The pressure is ramped up from 0 to 1 GPa on the inside and from 0 to 0.1 MPa
on the outside over a time of 10 microsecs.
\begin{lstlisting}
   <PhysicalBC>
     <MPM>
       <pressure>
         <geom_object>
           <cylinder label = "inner cylinder">
             <bottom>           [0.0,0.0,0.0]   </bottom>

         </geom_object>
         <load_curve>

             <top>              [0.0,0.0,.02]   </top>
             <radius>           1.0             </radius>
           </cylinder>
         </geom_object>
         <load_curve>
           <id>2</id>
           <time_point>
             <time> 0 </time>
             <load> 0 </load>
           </time_point>
           <time_point>
             <time> 1.0e-5 </time>
             <load> 101325.0 </load>
           </time_point>
         </load_curve>
       </pressure>
     </MPM>
   </PhysicalBC>
\end{lstlisting}
The complete input file can be found in \TT{inputs/MPM/thickCylinderMPM.ups}. 
An additional example which is used to achieve triaxial loading can be found
at \TT{inputs/MPM/TXC.ups}.  There, the material geometry is a block, and so
the regions described are flat surfaces upon which the pressure is applied.

\section{On the Fly DataAnalysis} \label{Sec:OTFA_MPM}

In the event that one wishes to monitor the data for a small region of a
simulation at a rate that is more frequent than the what the DataArchiver
can reasonably provide (for reasons of data storage and effect on run time),
Uintah provides a \tt <DataAnalysis> \normalfont feature.  As it applies
to MPM, it allows one to specify a group of particles, by assigning those
particles a particular value of the \tt <color> \normalfont parameter.
In addition, a list of variables and a frequency of output is provided.
Then, at run time, a sub-directory (\tt particleExtract/L-0 \normalfont)
is created inside the uda which contains
a series of files, named according to their particle IDs, one for each
tagged particle.  Each of these files contains the time and position for
that particle, along with whatever other data is specified.  {\bf To use this
feature, one must include the} \tt <withColor>   true   </withColor> \normalfont
{\bf tag in the} \tt <MPM> \normalfont {\bf section of the input file.}
(See Section~\ref{Sec:MPMFlags}.)

The following input file snippet is taken from
\tt inputs/MPM/disks.ups \normalfont  
\begin{lstlisting}
    <DataAnalysis>
       <Module name="particleExtract">

        <material>disks</material>
        <samplingFrequency> 1e10 </samplingFrequency>
        <timeStart>          0   </timeStart>
        <timeStop>          100  </timeStop>
        <colorThreshold>
          0
        </colorThreshold>

        <Variables>
          <analyze label="p.velocity"/>
          <analyze label="p.stress"/>
        </Variables>

      </Module>
    </DataAnalysis>
\end{lstlisting}

For all particles that are assigned a color greater than the
\tt <colorThreshold>, \normalfont the variables
\tt p.velocity \normalfont and
\tt p.stress \normalfont are saved every every
$1/$\tt <samplingFrequency> \normalfont time units, starting at
\tt <timeStart> \normalfont until
\tt <timeStop>. \normalfont

It is also possible to save grid based data with this module,
see Section~\ref{Sec:ICE} for more information.

\section{Prescribed Motion} \label{Sec:PrescribedMotion} The prescribed motion
capability in Uintah allows the user to prescribe arbitrary material
deformations and superimposed rotations.  This capability is particularly
useful in verifying that the constitutive model is behaving as expected and is
frame indifferent.  To prescribe material motion the following tag must be
included in the \tt <MPM> \normalfont section of the input file:

\begin{lstlisting}
 <MPM>
     <UsePrescribedDeformation>true</UsePrescribedDeformation>
 </MPM>
\end{lstlisting}

The desired motion must then be specified in a file named \tt time\_defgrad\_rotation \normalfont.  The format of this file is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
t0 F11 F12 F13 F21 F22 F23 F31 F32 F33 theta0 a0 a1 a2
t1 F11 F12 F13 F21 F22 F23 F31 F32 F33 theta1 a0 a1 a2
. . .
tn F11 F12 F13 F21 F22 F23 F31 F32 F33 thetan a0 a1 a2

\end{lstlisting}
where the first column is time, columns two through ten are the nine components of the prescribed deformation gradient, the eleventh column is the desired rotation angle, and the remaining three columns are the three components of the axis of prescribed rotation.  The components of the deformation gradient are linearly interpolated for times between those specified in the table.  The axis of rotation may be changed for each specified time.  As a result, the angle of rotation about the specified axis linearly increases from zero to the specified value at the end of the specified interval.  For example, the following table:

\begin{lstlisting}
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 90 0 0 1
2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 91 0 0 1
\end{lstlisting}
specifies a pure rotation (no stretch) about the 3-axis.  At time=0 the material will have rotated 90 degrees about the 3-axis.  At time=2 the material will have rotated an additional 91 degrees about the 3-axis for a total of 181 degrees of rotation.  As a warning to the user, it is possible to specify the deformation gradient such that interpolating between to entries in the table results in a singular deformation gradient.  For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
2 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
\end{lstlisting}
would result in the simulation failing due to a negative jacobian error between time=1 and time=2 since the 11 and 22 components are linearly varying from 1 to -1 during that time, which will attempt to invert the computational cell.  The deformation gradient at time=2 corresponds to a 180 degree rotation about the 3-axis, and can be accomplished using the rotation feature described above.

As a final example the table:
\begin{lstlisting}
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0.5 0 0 0 0.5 0 0 0 0.5 45 0 1 0
2 0.5 0 0 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 0.5 90 0 0 1
\end{lstlisting}
would result in 50\% hydrostatic compression at time=1 with a 45 degree superimposed rotation about the 2-axis, followed by  simple shear and a 90 degree rotation about the 3-axis between time=1 and time=2.

\section{Cohesive Zones} \label{Sec:CohesiveZones}
A cohesive zone formulation is available in Uintah based on the description
by Daphalapurkar, et al.~\cite{Daphalapurkar}.  As in their implementation,
that in Uintah has several limitations.  It is limited to a 2D implementation,
and the cohesive zone segments are assumed to not rotate or deform.

In order to use cohesive zones, the following field must be added to the
\tt <MPM> \normalfont section of the input file:

\begin{lstlisting}
 <MPM>
     <use_cohesive_zones>true</use_cohesive_zones>
 </MPM>
\end{lstlisting}

The traction functions used in Uintah are those given in Eq. 15
of~\cite{Daphalapurkar}.  These require 4 input parameters.  They are
$\sig_{max}$, $\tau_{max}$, $\delta_n$ and $\delta_t$, the cohesive strengths
in the normal and shear directions, and the displacement jumps in the normal and
tangential directions corresponding to the maximum normal and shear strength
values, respectively.

In an input file, the description of a cohesive zone looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
            <cohesive_zone>
              <sig_max> 240. </sig_max>
              <tau_max> 240. </tau_max>
              <delta_n> 0.00004   </delta_n>
              <delta_t> 0.0000933 </delta_t>
              <cz_filename>HOM.txt</cz_filename>
            </cohesive_zone>
\end{lstlisting}

Note that in addition to the four parameters listed above, a cohesive zone
filename is also specified.  The format of this file will be described below.
Units on the strength and displacement correspond to the units for
stress and length used in the remainder of the input file.

Cohesive zones describe a cohesion law between adjacent materials. As such,
they take the place of a contact model.  Thus, when using cohesive zones to
describe the interaction of materials 1 and 2, the contact section of the input
file would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
            <contact>
                <type>null</type>
                <materials>[1,2]</materials>
            </contact>
\end{lstlisting}

Use of friction or approach contact to describe interaction between objects
subsequent to decohesion should be possible and is being investigated.

The traction that is applied to the two materials governed by a
cohesive zone model is based on the displacement between those two materials,
both normal and tangential.  The two adjacent materials are referred to in the
implementation as the ``Top" and ``Bottom" materials.  A normal and tangential
vector describes the orientation of the cohesive zone surface.  The convention
for the normal vector is that it points in the direction from the bottom
material to the top material.  With this information in hand, we can describe
the format of the \tt <cz\_filename> \normalfont mentioned above.

\begin{lstlisting}
px1 py1 pz1 length1 normx1 normy1 normz1 tangx1 tangy1 tangz1 botmat1 topmat1
px2 py2 pz2 length2 normx2 normy2 normz2 tangx2 tangy2 tangz2 botmat2 topmat2
. . .
pxN pyN pzN lengthN normxN normyN normzN tangxN tangyN tangzN botmatN topmatN
\end{lstlisting}

where the first three columns are the x, y and z coordinates of the position, 
the fourth column is the length, the fifth through seventh column is the normal
direction (x, y, z) and the eighth through tenth column is the tangential
direction (x, y, z).  Finally, the eleventh and twelth columns are the bottom
and top material indices, respectively.

An example of 3 cohesive zone segments follows:

As a 2D simulation in Uintah is actually a 3D simulation that is 1 cell thick,
the ``length" parameter described above is actually going to be an area.
Namely, the length in the plane of the simulation multiplied by the domain
thickness in the out of plane direction.

\section{Particle Insertion} \label{Sec:ParticleInsert}
MPM has the ability to insert or transport blocks of particles into or
 around the computational domain.  The functionality uses a time threshold for 
activation of the insertion. Currently, capabilities include translation some 
distances x, y and z and initiation of a new ``initial" velocity vector.  Particles, 
defined by color, specified as an integer, in the geometry object section of the 
input file, can have a limitless number of transformations applied to them.  
There are no limits to how many geometry objects can be specified, however,
each transformation can only act on one color index.  Thus movement of more than
one block of particles can require multiple input lines.
 
This functionality is defined in a text file in the order: 

\begin{lstlisting}
<time> <color> <trans x> <trans y> <trans z> <new x vel> <new y vel> <new z vel>
\end{lstlisting}  

During the first timestep in which the current physical time plus the calculated 
$\Delta$t for the current timestep exceeds the time specified for a color block, the 
particles of that color will be translated along the three coordinates and given 
a new velocity.  Each line in the file can be used to define a unique transformation
for one particle color group.  For instance, if a file contained the line:

\begin{lstlisting}
0.1 1 10 10 0 0 0 8 
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent after `0.1 s' of physical time any particle of color `1' will be translated 10 
units in the positive x and y direction, 0 units in the positive z direction 
and given a new velocity of 8 units/s in the positive z direction, with no 
velocity in the x or y direction.

Particle insertion is activated and directed with the following flags found in the 
MPM section of the input file:
\begin{lstlisting}
<MPM>
    <withColor>         true   </withColor>
    <InsertParticles>   true   </InsertParticles>
    <InsertParticlesFile>  "path/to/file.txt" </InsertParticlesFile>
</MPM>
\end{lstlisting}

An example problem exists in ``inputs/MPM/" named Extrude that demonstrates 
particle insertion.  ``extrude.ups" defines the problem setup, ``extrude.xml" defines 
the geometry objects (also where the color is defined) and then pulled in to 
``extrude.ups", and ``insert.dat" which defines the times, translations and new 
velocity of the particle blocks.  Figure ~\ref{figinsertparticles} shows an image 
of a simulation in progress that uses particle insertion.  The image shows a stream 
of rubbery material flying into the domain and folding on itself.  Another particularly 
useful idea to note from the image, is the secondary box above the normal domain, in which 
the particles to be inserted reside before they are inserted.  Current application 
of particle insertion tends to follow this motif.

\subsection*{\center Sphere Rolling Down an Inclined Plane}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sphere Rolling Down an Inclined Plane}
\paragraph*{\underline{Problem Description}}
Here, a sphere of soft plastic, initially at rest, rolls under the
influence of gravity down a plane of a harder plastic.  Gravity is
oriented such that the plane is effectively angled at 45 degrees to
the horizontal.  This simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of
the contact algorithm, described in~\cite{Bard01}.  Frictional
contact, using a friction coefficient of $\mu = 0.495$ causes the ball
to start rolling as it impacts the plane, after being dropped from
barely above it.  The same simulation is also run using a friction
coefficient of $\mu = 0.0$.  The difference in the results is shown
below.

\subsection*{\center Crushing a Foam Microstructure}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Crushing a Foam Microstructure}
\paragraph*{\underline{Problem Description}}
This calculation demonstrates two important strength of MPM.  The first
is the ability to quickly generate a computational representation of
complex geometries.  The second is the ability of the method to handle
large deformations, including self contact.

In particular, in this calculation a small sample of foam, the geometry
for which was collected using microCT, is represented via material points.
The sample is crushed to 87.5\% compaction through the use of a rigid plate, which
acts as a constant velocity boundary condition on the top of the sample.  This
calculation is a small example of those described in \cite{brydonfoam}.  The
geometry of the foam is created by image procesing the CT data, and based
on the intensity of each voxel in the image data, the space represented
by that voxel either recieves a particle with the material properties of the
foam's constituent material, or is left as void space.  This particle
representation avoids the time consuming steps required to build a suitable
unstructured mesh for this very complicated geometry.
 
\paragraph*{\underline{Simulation Specifics}}
\begin{description} 
\item [Component used:] \hfill MPM
\item [Input file name:] \hfill foam.ups
\item [Instruction to run input file:]

First, copy foam.ups and foam.pts.gz to the same directory as sus.
Adjust the number of patches in the ups file based on
the number of processors available to you for this run.
First, uncompress the pts file:
\begin{lstlisting}
 gunzip foam.pts.gz
\end{lstlisting}

Then the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
 tools/pfs/pfs foam.ups
\end{lstlisting}
will divide the foam.pts
file, which contains the geometric description of the foam,
into number of patches smaller files, named foam.pts.0,
foam.pts.1, etc.  This is done so that for large simulations,
each processor is only reading that data which it needs, and
prevents the thrashing of the file system that would occur
if each processor needed to read the entire pts file.  This
command only needs to be done once, or anytime the patch
distibution is changed.  Note that this step must be done even
if only one processor is available.

To run this simulation:
\begin{lstlisting}
  mpirun -np NP sus foam.ups
\end{lstlisting}
where NP is the number of processors being used.

Figure~\ref{figfoam} shows a snapshot of the simulation via isosurfacing,
as the foam is at about 50\% compaction.

  \caption{Compaction of a foam microstructure shown via isosurfacing.}

Figure~\ref{figfoampart} shows a snapshot of the simulation via particles
colored by equivalent stress as the foam is at about 60\% compaction.

  \caption{Compaction of a foam microstructure rendered as particles colored
           by equivalent stress.}
  \label{figfoampart}
\end{figure}

In this simulation, the reaction forces at 5 of the 6 computational boundaries
are also recorded and can be viewed using a simple plotting package such
as gnuplot.  At each timestep, the internal force at each of the boundaries
is accumulated and stored in ``dat" files within the uda,
e.g. BndyForce\_zminus.dat.  Because the reaction force is a vector, it
is enclosed in square brackets which may be removed by use of a script in
the inputs directory:

\begin{lstlisting}
cd foam.uda.000
../inputs/ICE/Scripts/removeBraces BndyForce\_zminus.dat
gnuplot
gnuplot> plot "BndyForce\_zminus.dat" using 1:4
gnuplot> quit
\end{lstlisting}

These reaction forces are similar to what would be measured on a mechanical
testing device, and help to understand the material behavior.

A flat plate with a hole in the center is loaded in tension.  To achieve a

\subsection*{\center Tungsten Sphere Impacting a Steel Target}

\paragraph*{\underline{Problem Description}}
A $1 mm$ tungsten sphere with an initial velocity of $5000 m/s$
impacts a steel target.  Axisymmetric conditions are used in this case,
conversion of the input file to the full 3D simulation is straightforward.
The user may wish to do both simulations of both to gain confidence in the
applicability of axisymmetry. 

This simulation exercises the \tt elastic\_plastic \normalfont
constitutive model for the
steel material. This includes sub-models for equations of state,
variable shear modulus, melting, plasticity, etc.  The tungsten is modeled
using the \tt comp\_neo\_hook\_plastic, \normalfont which is simple vonMises
plasticity with linear hardening.  One difficulty with using the more 
sophisticated models is that parameters can be difficult to find for many
materials.

\subsection{Method Of Manufactured Solutions (MMS)}
There are three manufactured solutions available in Uintah for nonlinear elastic constitutive models. The input files are available in the {\tt inputs/MPM} folder. 
\begin{lstlisting}
AA.ups (Axis Aligned MMS)
GenVortex.ups (Genralized Vortex MMS)
Ring_MMS.ups (Expanding Ring MMS)
\end{lstlisting}
All these input files have the following tag included in the {\tt <MPM>} section of the input file:
\begin{lstlisting}
<MPM>
   <RunMMSProblem>Name of the MMS</RunMMSProblem>	
</MPM>
\end{lstlisting}
The exact solutions for these problems are available in {\tt puda}, and the call to extract the error is
\begin{lstlisting}
puda -AA_MMS_2 AA_MMS.uda (for AxisAligned MMS)
puda -GV_MMS GenVortex.uda (for Generalized Vortex MMS)
puda -ER_MMS Ring_MMS.uda (for Expanding Ring MMS)
\end{lstlisting}

The current implementation allows the user to add a new manufactured solution in the {\tt MPM} component in a relatively-straight forward way. The current implementation of these manufactured solutions are located in {\tt src/CCA/Components/MPM/MMS} folder.
The following files require modifications either to change the exisiting MMS or add a new one.
\begin{lstlisting}
1) src/CCA/Components/MPM/MPMFlags.cc
2) src/StandAlone/inputs/UPS_SPEC/mpm_spec.xml
3) src/CCA/Components/MPM/MMS/MMS.cc
4) src/CCA/Components/MPM/ConstitutiveModel/CNH_MMS.cc (Right now, all these MMS use
the same constitutive model. User can change the constitutive model accordingly)
5) src/StandAlone/tools/puda/puda.cc
\end{lstlisting}
Following are the sequential steps to add a new MMS to the existing framework. 
\newline
1) In {\tt MPMFlags.cc}, add another {\tt if} condition for the new MMS string in the following {\tt loop}
\begin{lstlisting}
if(d_mms_type=="AxisAligned"){
    d_mms_type = "AxisAligned";
  } else if(d_mms_type=="GeneralizedVortex"){
    d_mms_type = "GeneralizedVortex";
  } else if(d_mms_type=="ExpandingRing"){
    d_mms_type = "ExpandingRing";
  } else if(d_mms_type=="AxisAligned3L"){
    d_mms_type = "AxisAligned3L";
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
2) Add the same string in the {\tt <RunMMSProblem>} tag located in the {\tt mpm\_spec.xml} file.
\newline
3) There are two member functions available in {\tt MMS.cc}.
\begin{lstlisting}
		MMS::initializeParticleForMMS
		MMS::computeExternalForceForMMS
\end{lstlisting}
Similar to step $1$, add another {\tt if} condition in both the member functions for the new MMS. In the {\tt initializeParticleForMMS} function, initialize the particle data at time $t=0$, and in the {\tt computeExternalForceForMMS} function, code the analytical body forces. The exisiting analytical solutions can be used as a guide.
\newline
4) Add the exact solution in the {\tt src/StandAlone/tools/puda} folder. Look at the {\tt AA\_MMS.cc, GV\_MMS.cc, and ER\_MMS.cc} for reference. Add the option for the new MMS in the {\tt puda.cc} file.
\newline
5) If the new MMS has a non-zero stress, necessary modifications needs to be made in the {\tt initializeCMData} function located in that particular constitutive model (CNH\_MMS.cc for reference).
