\chapter{MPM Constitutive Models} \label{Sec:ConstitutiveModels}

The MPM code contains a large number of constitutive models that provide
a Cauchy stress on each particle based on the velocity gradient computed at
that particle.  The following is a list and very brief description of 
the most commonly used models.  The reader may wish to consult the
\tt inputs/MPM \normalfont and \tt inputs/MPMICE \normalfont directories
to find explicit examples of the use of these models, and others not
described in this section.
