\section{Rigid Material}  This model was designed for use with the
\tt specified \normalfont contact model described in Section~\ref{Sec:Contact}.
It is designed to compute zero stress and deformation of the material,
and is basically a fast place holder for materials that won't be developing
a stress anyway.
