\section{Rigid Material}  This model was designed for use with the
\Textsfc{specified contact} model described in Section~\ref{Sec:Contact}.
It is designed to compute zero stress and identity deformation of the material,
and is basically a fast place-holder for materials that should not develop
any stress.
