Links to some material and simulation data that we have made publicly available.
The simulation data consists of input files for various packages.

## High-rate and high-temperature experiments

Our data on steel, aluminum, and copper have been made freely available at [https://github.com/bbanerjee/HighRateExptData](https://github.com/bbanerjee/HighRateExptData).

## Concrete and plastic simulations

Input files for the simulation of concrete/plastic interaction have been made available at [https://github.com/bbanerjee/ConcreteSim](https://github.com/bbanerjee/ConcreteSim).

## Sandwich composite simulations
Input files for the sandwich composite simulations and verification can be downloaded from [https://github.com/bbanerjee/SandwichSim](https://github.com/bbanerjee/SandwichSim).

## Contact and adhesion simulations
Input files for adhesion simulations can be found at [https://github.com/bbanerjee/AdhesionSim](https://github.com/bbanerjee/AdhesionSim).

## Metamaterial simulation
Some of our metamaterial simulation input files have been made available at [https://github.com/bbanerjee/MetamaterialSim](https://github.com/bbanerjee/MetamaterialSim).
