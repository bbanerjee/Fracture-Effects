\chapter{Overview of GranularSim} \label{sec:overview} 
\GranularSim is a rewritten and updated version of the parallel discrete element code \ParaEllip
developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder, with the intent of having a more general
code that can be improved and appended to more easily.  The primary use case is the simulation
of soils and other granular materials.

The main components of \GranularSim include a discrete element (DEM) code that can handle
ellipsoidal particles, a peridynamics (PD) code that couples to DEM particles, and
a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code that also couples to DEM particles.
In addition, the code is able to handle special boundary conditions that are needed
for hierarchical upscaling.

\GranularSim provides outputs in VTK format and results can be visualized either
with \ParaView (\url{https://www.paraview.org/})
or with \Visit (\url{https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/}).

\section{Downloading and compiling the Code}
For instructions on downloading and compiling \GranularSim see the \Textbfc{Installation Guide}
which can be downloaded from 
\url{https://github.com/bbanerjee/ParSim/tree/master/GranularSim/Manuals/InstallationGuide}.

\section{Running the code}
\begin{WarningBox}
We will assume that you have compiled \GranularSim inside a directory called \Textsfc{opt}.
\end{WarningBox}

In the \Textsfc{opt} directory you will find the executable \Textsfc{granularsim}.  This is the
entry point for the simulation code.

A typical simulation can be run either on one processor or on multiple processors.  For
a single processor run, use

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh, backgroundcolor=\color{background}]
cd opt
./granularsim <input_file.xml>
\end{lstlisting}

For a multiprocessor run, use 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh, backgroundcolor=\color{background}]
cd opt
mpirun -np <num_processors> ./granularsim <input_file.xml>
\end{lstlisting}

On Cray machines, you may have to use a PBS script to runs jobs.  For jobs on
distributed computing machines, a common replacement for \Textsfc{mpirun} is \Textsfc{aprun}.
For interactive jobs on such machines you will need to use the alternative command
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh, backgroundcolor=\color{background}]
cd opt
aprun -n <num_processors> ./granularsim <input_file.xml>
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Input files}
\GranularSim does not have a user interface that you can use to generate input files.
Instead, you will have to create these files yourself.  The input files are is \Textsfc{XML}
format.  A snippet from such a file is given below.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='ISO-8859-1' ?>
<Ellip3D_input>

  <Meta>
     <title> DEM-PD simulation sample input file </title>
  </Meta>

  <!-- #simulation type -->
  <SimulationType>  001 </SimulationType>

  <!-- Parallel setup -->
  <Parallel>
    <!--
    #grids/processes in x, y, z directions for MPI parallelization, which
    #is recommended for more than thousands of particles. By default these
    #values are 1 for serial computing. They must satisfy equation:
    #mpiProcX * mpiProcY * mpiProcZ = np, where np is the number of processes
    #specified in mpirun command line.
    -->
    <mpiProc> [2, 1, 2] </mpiProc>

    <!--
    #threads per process for OpenMP parallelization, which is recommended 
    #for more than thousands of particles. By default this value is 1 for 
    #single-thread computing. If it > 1, multiple-threads computing is 
    #invoked.
    -->
    <ompThreads>  1 </ompThreads>
  </Parallel>
  .......
</Ellip3D_input>
\end{lstlisting}
Further details can be found in the chapter on input files {\Red Add link to chapter}.

\section{Output files}
\GranularSim simulations produce a number of output files for each timestep that is
saved.   Each simulation produces a new directory that contains a set of files that
are numbered sequentially. 
\begin{WarningBox}
At present, all important variables are saved and selective saves are not allowed.
\end{WarningBox}

The files that are generated are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \Textsfc{bdry\_contact\_nnnnn.csv} and \Textsfc{bdry\_contact\_nnnnn.xml} : Information about
        boundary contacts.
  \item \Textsfc{boundary\_nnnnn} : Information about the positions of the domain boundaries.
  \item \Textsfc{contact\_nnnnn.csv} and \Textsfc{contact\_nnnnn.xml} : Information about
        inter-particle contacts.
  \item \Textsfc{domain\_nnnnn.vtu} : VTK format files containing the positions of domain boundaries.
  \item \Textsfc{oriented\_domain\_nnnnn.vtu} : VTK format files containing the positions of domain 
        boundaries for domains (including those that are not axis-aligned).
  \item \Textsfc{output\_particles\_nnn.dat} : CSV format files containing the particle information.
  \item \Textsfc{particle\_nnnnn.vtu} : VTK format files containing the particle information.
  \item \Textsfc{patchGrid\_nnnnn.vtu} : VTK format files containing the domain decomposition
        information (patches).
\end{enumerate}

Further details can be found in the chapter on output files {\Red Add link to chapter}.

\section{Visualization}
The output generated by \GranularSim can be visualized in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Using a \Textsfc{R} script.
  \item Using \ParaView to read and visualize the \Textsfc{VTK} output files.
  \item Using \Visit to read and visualize the \Textsfc{VTK} output files.
\end{enumerate}

Details can be found in the chapter on visualization {\Red Add link to chapter}.
