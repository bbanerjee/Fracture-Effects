1) Single particle uniaxial stress simulations produce non-zero stresses
   in the transverse directions.  Find a way to apply Neumann BCs for 
   single particle simulations to produce the right results.

2) Allow rigid materials to be moved at constant velocity instead of
   losing momentum after contact.
